The project I have created was developed in order to create a functional dog database of rescues and shelters.
All the data, except for Owner info (to maintain privacy of users), was scraped from the web and is real.
Database was built in MySQL and is hostable to web interface via Node.js API framework.
API allows for read and write access to background database.
Plans are in progress to beautify site via Handlebars CSS templates.
